LATEST CHANGES:
---------------

-: Changes compared to official civ2civ3 v3.0 (included in Freeciv release):
*: Changes compared to previous civ2civ3_earth v2018_10 (available with Modpack Installer).

Known bugs:
* When the ruleset is played with a version of Freeciv prior to 3.0.8, the "Investigate city" action may cause a crash to desktop (related to the presence of traded resources in the target city). As an alternative, military units can use the "Bombard" action to see all defending units.

Fixed bugs:
* Strategic resources no longer appear on the same tile as other special resources.

Core:
* The 6th citizen in each city is the first unhappy one (was the 5th).
* Increased to 3 the output of Entertainer, Taxman and Scientist specialists (no longer increased by global effects of wonders).
- Added a new barbarian nation that controls hostile animal units, randomly placed at the start of the game.
* Storms are no longer enemy units, but terrain features that randomly appear and disappear on Deep Ocean or Glacier tiles, damaging adjacent units (-4 HP).
- Enabled national trade routes again, with reduced income. Each city can establish 1 trade route (2 after the discovery of The Corporation).
* Trade routes with foreign cities receive 50% of the income, and only if the cities are allies (or on the same team).
* When a Caravan/Freight arrives to a national city, it is possible to choose a new action that cancels the current trade routes of the city (at the end of the turn).
* Enabled tech leakage again, with halved effect (the cost of a technology known to all players would be half of the normal cost).
* The city tile gets the same +50% defense bonus as a Fort (also against naval units, not only against ground units). Cities with size > 8 double this bonus to +100% (as before). Cities with size > 16 now get an additional +50% defense against air and missile units (being the total defense the same as a Fortress).
* Waste of Food caused by distance to Palace is now relative to the map size, up to -10% Food for cities at max distance (-5% with Granary or Courthouse).
* Human players receive a negative AI Love, making it harder to keep the peace with every AI.

Optional (server options):
* Trading technologies in the diplomacy dialog is not allowed (otherwise the AI can't handle the following options).
- When you get a new tech by conquest, or diplomatic mission, half of its cost is subtracted from your pool of research points.
- If the pool of research points ends negative, and the negative points are greater than half the cost of the current research, then a random technology is lost, and only half of its value is returned to the research pool.

Terrains:
* Ground units starting the turn on unroaded Rivers have a -1 movement penalty (same as on Mountains). Forts and Airstrips on River tiles cannot be upgraded to full fortresses.
- Deep Ocean tiles require Supermarket (in addition to Harbour) to produce 1 extra Food.
* Forest and Jungle can be mined to produce Lumber (+1 production). Forests and Plains can no longer be transformed to Grassland at the beginning, only Grassland to Forest (10 turns), Forest to Plains (10 turns), and Plains to Forest (10 turns).
- Added some new resources, up to 3 per terrain: Incense (+4 trade on desert), Deer (+2 food on forest, while Pheasant now +1 food and +1 trade), Marble (+1 production and +1 trade on hills), Ivory (now on jungle, with 1 less trade), Seals (same bonuses as Ivory, but on glacier), Shellfish (+1 food and +1 trade on oceans and lakes), Salt (+1 production and +1 trade on coastal ocean), Horses (+1 production and +1 trade on plains, while Buffalo now +1 food and +1 production), Sugar (+2 food and +2 trade on swamp).
- There are now 6 resources on Grassland, with 3 different effects: Cattle or Corn (+1 food), Wool or Cotton (+1 production), Tea or Tobacco (+2 trade).
- There are also 4 extra strategic resources that can be used when certain tech is researched by the player (adding +2 production in the tile): Niter (on plains or desert, usable with Gunpowder), Rubber (on jungle, swamp or forest, with Chemistry), Aluminum (on hills or tundra, with Industrialization), Uranium (on mountains or glacier, with Atomic Theory).
- All resources slightly reduce the chance of plague, so they can be seen in the city UI. Resources traded from other cities slightly increase the risk of plague.
- When 2 cities are linked by a trade route: any special resource present in one city (within the city radius) is considered to be available in the other city too. For each resource traded to a city that did not have it, the city receives an extra bonus:
  - Luxury resources (Incense, Silk, Tea, Tobacco, Wine, Gems, Gold, Shellfish, Spice, Furs): +1 Luxury in cities linked by trade route.
  - Food resources (Seals, Oasis, Pheasant, Deer, Cattle, Corn, Fruit, Fish, Whales, Wheat, Buffalo, Sugar, Game): +1 unit free of upkeep in cities linked by trade route.
  - Production resources (Oil, Wool, Cotton, Coal, Marble, Ivory, Iron, Salt, Horse, Peat; Niter, Rubber, Aluminum, Uranium): +1 Production in cities linked by trade route.
* Some units get additional veteran levels when certain resources are available in the city:
  - Strategic resources (Horses, Ivory; Rubber, Aluminum, Uranium): +1 veteran level for certain units built in the city (or in a city linked by trade route).
  - Key resources (Iron, Niter, Oil). For units that require Iron, Niter: -1 veteran level for each one of these resources that is not available in the city. For units that require Iron/Oil: -1 veteran level if none of these resources are available in the city.
* Power Plants require Oil resource available in the city. Nuclear Plants and Manhattan Project require Uranium. Apollo Program requires Aluminum.
* Added Natural Wonders, that produce +2 Luxury points in the tile, and increase a bit the risk of natural disasters in a city. Marked with a text label and a red flag icon on the map. They are destroyed when the underlying terrain is transformed.

Culture:
- Enabled culture points, generated in each city by wonders, and by scientific or religious buildings. Enabled achievements, that can give extra culture.
- The culture accumulated by each city increases its resistance in diplomatic fights against enemy agents (up to +50%).
- The culture accumulated by your nation increases the cost of bribing your units or inciting your cities (up to +500%). It no longer affects the chance of civil war.
- Governments no longer get immunity against bribe or incite actions. Cities with a Courthouse or a Palace are now immune to incite actions.

Governments:
- Halved the chance of civil war for every government.
- The appearance of Partisans in conquered cities requires the owner to have knowledge of Guerrilla Warfare.
- Added a new government: Fascism (available with Military Tactics, which requires Leadership and Conscription).
* Empire Size no longer depends on the government chosen. Every time a new government becomes available, the Empire Size increases by 2, from 4 at the beginning, up to 20 when all governments have been discovered.
* Corruption and waste by distance are fixed to 2% per tile for ancient governments, 1% for modern governments, and 0% for Federation and Communism; no longer tied to the research of Trade or The Corporation techs.
* Tribal (available with Warrior Code) gets 3 units per city free of upkeep; +1 content per city, instead of martial law; +75% Luxury from the Palace; and extra vision range for ground units. Federation gets +2 Luxury points per city.
* Republic and Democracy get the +1 Trade bonus only on tiles with an irrigation, regardless if the tile wasn't producing any trade.
* Republic is restored to get both "Has senate" and "Revolution when unhappy" effects, the same as Democracy. Federation no longer has a senate.
* Max tax rates changed to 80% for Federation and 90% for Communism.
* Under Fascism or Communism, you do not pay upkeep for buildings that cost 1 or 2 coins (was only buildings that cost 1 coin).
* Under Fascism or Fundamentalism, citizens of enemy nationality cause extra unhappiness in the city (1 unhappy face for each 2 enemy citizens).
* Fundamentalism no longer gets any penalty to Science output. Anarchy doesn't get any penalty to Luxury output.

Techs:
* Astronomy increases vision range of cities and fortresses. Electricity grants you vision within your borders.
* Feudalism: allows to upgrade a Fortress to a Castle when it is within your national borders. Castles protect full stacks from dying when one unit is defeated.
* Medicine: allows non-wheeled ground units to recover 2 HP per turn, on plains or grassland, even without resting. Physics allows the same for wheeled units (on plains or grassland), and for naval units on shallow ocean.
* Metallurgy: Galleon, Frigate and Ironclad are built veteran at cities with Iron and Niter resources. They are no longer affected by the Lighthouse veteran bonus.
- Explosives allow new terrain improvements: Naval Mines to increase the defense of shallow oceans and damage adjacent naval units; Canals to connect oceans separated by no more than 2 land tiles.
- Labor Union: allows cities to build engineers with one additional veteran level.
* Computers: Cities are continuously visible despite fog-of-war (once Internet wonder have been built by any player).
* Genetic Engineering: Reduces the risk of plague in all your cities by -10% (once Cure for Cancer wonder has been built by any player).
* Fusion Power: reduces -25% the pollution from Nuclear Plants, making them equivalent to Solar Plants. Nuclear Plant production is no longer doubled.

Buildings:
- Added a new building: Hospital (available with Medicine), which reduces the chance of plague in the city (old effect of Medicine), increases the size limit of the city, and allows damaged land units (non-wheeled) to recover half of their hit points.
* Aqueduct increases the size limit of the city by 4 (by 8 together with a Hospital). Sewer System increases the size limit by 8 (together with a Hospital the size is unlimited).
* The effect of Barracks, Port Facility and Airport to recover damaged units has been reduced from 100% to 50%. In cities with both Barracks and Hospital, non-wheeled ground units are completely restored in one turn.
- Buildings with a defense bonus are visible to others (middle click on the city).
- Mass Transit neutralizes all the pollution generated by the population (was 50%).
* The pollution threshold of each city increased from 20 to 30. Pollution caused by population is increased by Supermarket (instead of Offshore Platforms), Super Highways, Factory and Mfg Plant.
* Super Highways produce one additional trade point in tiles with roads, but without mines nor farmlands, even if the tile was not producing any trade. It allows any terrain to produce trade (instead of extra food or shields), useful in the case of forests or irrigated land (as an alternative to Supermarkets).
* Amphitheatre effect reduced from 3 to 2 content citizens (upkeep cost from 4 to 2). Now, a city with all the buildings that make citizens content can neutralize up to 12 unhappy citizens.
* Research Lab doubles the effect of Library and University in the city (+50% for each one). Library and University are no longer required to build parts of the spaceship.
* Doubled the coins needed to buy spaceship parts (same as wonders).

Combat:
* When attacking, it is now possible to choose between different actions (if available for the unit): regular attack, capture, or bombard.
* Bombard action is only allowed for 1 unit from each tile per turn. It allows to damage all the units in the target tile without the risk of being damaged back. 
  When a unit performs a bombard from a tile, a marker appears on that tile and prevents other units to bombard from the same tile until the next turn.
  Until this bombardment marker disappears at the end of the turn, if there is no city nor base in the tile, it gets the same defense bonus as if there was a Fort: +50% against land and sea units. This bonus is only useful for the player who moves earlier in the turn order (only for the AI in the case of single player games).
* Flag Bombarder: All units with ranged weapons or firearms get the ability to bombard. The bombard rate (damage caused) is 1 for each 10 hit points of the unit, and is increased by 1 in the case of air bombers.
* Flag AirBomber: Air bombers attack with a limited number of combat rounds, equal to their bombard rate, allowing them to first perform a regular attack (with the possibility of killing damaged enemy units, and the risk of being damaged back), and then bombard in the same turn.
* Flag HPFull: Air units and Submarines can't attack when damaged, but they can always bombard.
* Flag AutoAtt: Auto-attack enabled only for air fighters and submarines. These units can attack (or perform a bombardment, if they are damaged) against an incoming enemy.

Units:
* Defense bonus of +25% for units stacked outside of cities, as long as there is another unit on the same tile.
* Armor gets a +25% defense bonus against other Armor units. This makes armor slightly better than Mech. Infantry against attacks from Armors, and slightly worse against attacks from Howitzers or other units.
- Increased the number of veteran levels by one, with the following effects: 100%, 125%, 150%, 175%, and 200%. Engineers up to 150%.
* Units do not gain veterancy from combat if the enemy is not killed.
- All military infantry units can build fortresses. All worker units can build airbases. Non-military units cannot pillage.
* The work time required to build a base is equal to the movement cost of the terrain.
* Cavalry units are no longer slowed down when damaged. Crusaders get defense 2 (was 1).
* Wheeled units (Big Land class) can bombard non-native tiles (including oceans).
- Nuclear weapons have to start the turn in a city with an Airport in order to move (until the discovery of Rocketry).
* Missiles can disembark from their transporter unit, but they need a city or airbase to embark again.
* All air units can now cause unhappiness when they end the turn outside national borders (Air bombers and Nuclear missiles all the time, even inside national borders).
* Diplomat/Spy and Stealth aircraft are no longer invisible. Otherwise, detecting them may require some micromanagement.
* Homeless agents can no longer bribe units. New actions for Diplomat and Spy: expel non-military units out of your territory if you are at peace with the target; expel diplomatic or unreachable units if they are not within their own national borders or inside bases; steal map fragments from foreign cities.
* Some adjustments to the HP recover rate of units. See the new table (in README file).

Naval units:
- Defense bonus of +50% in Deep Ocean (or shallow Ocean adjacent to a Naval Mine) against Sea units (but not against Submarines).
- Trireme replaced by Galley, which can no longer navigate rivers, and is made obsolete by Caravels.
* Frigates can capture Galleons and Caravels (only when they are not carrying any load).
* Cargo boats don't cause unhappiness due to military activity, including Galley, Caravel, Galleon, Transport, Carrier and Submarine.
- Enabled ZOC for Sea units in Deep Ocean. Cargo boats and Submarines do not impose ZOC to enemy units. Air units can be used to ignore enemy ZOCs.
- Reduced a bit the cost of several naval units.
- Reduced a bit some vision ranges. Most air and naval units see 2 tiles horizontally/vertically, and 1 tile diagonally (same as Explorers), except AEGIS cruiser and Stealth Fighter/Bomber that can see 2 tiles diagonally too.
* AEGIS cruiser doubles its defense against air attacks (was x5). Destroyer doubles its defense and its attack against Submarine.
* New unit class for Submarines, that can not attack other Submarines. Defense reduced to 4, but doubled against air attacks.

Wonders:
* Readjusted effects and obsolescence of many wonders. See the table (in README file).
* The construction of a wonder no longer requires the presence of other buildings in the city. This way, most wonders appear as available in every city, and it is easier to keep track of them. However, some wonders still require another building in the city in order to get the bonus, and some of them require adjacent water ("Lighthouse", "Magellan's Expedition", "Hoover Dam") or specific resources available in the city ("Manhattan Project" and "Apollo Program").
* Continental range: "J.S. Bach's Cathedral", "Great Wall" and "Sun Tzu's War Academy" affects only to cities of the same continent.
* Global range: some minor effects, that may affect every player, added to "Cure For Cancer", "Internet", and "Women's Suffrage".
