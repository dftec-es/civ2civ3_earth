Nuclear units starting the turn in a city with an Airport gain a range of 8 too (up to 16 with Rocketry).","On impact, the blast will destroy any unit in an area 3 tiles wide (3x3 squares for rectangular grids), including friendly units. Any city within the blast area loses half its population, and land tiles within the blast area are subject to nuclear fallout. ","Nuclear fallout reduces tile output and increases the risk of global nuclear winter; see the help on Fallout.","TIP: You may be involved in a situation where you've invaded an enemy country en masse, but the enemy cities are too strong. Before using a Nuclear unit, assemble a gang of cleanup units next to the city and have them ready to fix the fallout on the same turn it occurs! This minimizes the chance of nuclear winter.

helptext="A Diplomat is an official that carries your dispatches and is authorized to deal with foreign dignitaries. He may also undertake various covert operations with the intent of harming your opponents; Diplomats in your own cities defend them against such actions.","Many covert actions may be attempted even in peacetime, but the more aggressive actions will be discovered and cause diplomatic incidents, giving an excuse for the breaking of treaties by a Republic or Democracy, or a nuclear-armed regime otherwise restrained by the United Nations.","If a foreign unit is alone on a tile, you may attempt to bribe it with your Diplomat. By paying a sum of gold the unit will immediately become yours; the exact sum depends on the status of the unit and that of the civilization owning it. Bribery when not at war will cause a diplomatic incident. Homeless Diplomats cannot bribe units.","Diplomats can expel non military units out of your territory if you are at peace with the target, and can expel diplomatic or unreachable units if they are not inside their own national borders or inside bases.","Diplomats can also perform a number of actions in another player's city, although each Diplomat may attempt only one action. Most of these actions have a chance of failure. Also, any enemy Diplomats or Spies in the city will oppose hostile actions, as will the enemy Leader in games with leaders; in this case, either your unit or the defending unit will die (if you go up against the Leader you will always die). If the defending unit dies, you lose one movement point and may try again. ","The actions available to Diplomats in a city are:"," - \"Establish Embassy\": This action always succeeds, and gives permanent contact with the city's owner, as well as intelligence on their tax rates and technology. Each player you have an embassy with that knows a technology reduces that technology's research cost to you."," - \"Investigate City\": Your unit attempts to report detailed information about the city: its status, what buildings and units are within, and what it is currently producing. The unit is not consumed by this action."," - \"Sabotage City\": Your unit attempts either to disrupt all the city's work so far towards its current project, or to destroy an existing building in the city, at random. Once built, Palaces and Wonders cannot be sabotaged, and attempts to sabotage City Walls or any building in a capital each halve the chance of success. Sabotage may only be attempted when openly at war."," - \"Steal Technology\": Your unit attempts to learn the secrets of a random technology known to the city's owner but not to you. Technology may only be stolen once from a given enemy city by Diplomats. This action may be attempted even when not at war, but will cause a diplomatic incident."," - \"Incite a Revolt\": In return for gold a foreign city will change allegiance and join your empire, bringing along all nearby units that call it home, but reducing its size by 1. Units in other cities remain in the enemy's control, but units outside cities are lost to both players. The exact sum depends on the status of the city and that of the civilization that owns it. It is not possible to incite a rebellion in a capital, or in any city with Courthouse. Incitement may be attempted in peacetime, but will cause a diplomatic incident.","Diplomats built under Communist or Federation governments will start at the first veteran level (secretary).","The cost to bribe units or incite cities increases +50% for each 1000 culture points accumulated by the target player, up to +500% (as if the distance to the capital was 6 times lower) when the player reaches 10000 culture points.","A city gets +5% resistance in diplomatic fights against enemy agents for each 100 culture points, up to +50% when the city reaches 1000 culture points."
